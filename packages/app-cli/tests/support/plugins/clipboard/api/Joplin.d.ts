/**
 * This is the main entry point to the Joplin API. You can access various services using the provided accessors.
 *
 * The API is now relatively stable and in general maintaining backward compatibility is a top priority, so you shouldn't except much breakages.
 *
 * If a breaking change ever becomes needed, best effort will be done to:
 *
 * - Deprecate features instead of removing them, so as to give you time to fix the issue;
 * - Document breaking changes in the changelog;
 *
 * So if you are developing a plugin, please keep an eye on the changelog as everything will be in there with information about how to update your code.
