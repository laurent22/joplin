<p>
	Some URLs in the Rich_Text_Editor contain <code>_</code> characters, but haven't been converted
	to links yet. For example, https://www.example.com/a_test_of_links.
</p>
<p>We should preserve the underscores _without escaping them_ to prevent the links from breaking.</p>
<p>
	This should also correctly handle unicode characters. For example, punctuation❯_requires escapes_,
	but 𝔏𝔈𝔗𝔗𝔈𝕽_𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔰_and_897_numbers_𝒟on_'t.
</p>
<p>
	_Note_ that what [_causes_] a `_` to create italics_ seems to depend only on the character before
	and an escape at the _beginning_ seems to be sufficient.
</p>
<p>_s also don't need escapes if _ followed _ by a _space.</p>
