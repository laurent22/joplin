# generate-plugin-doc

This package is only to run the buildPluginDoc command. The version of typedoc we use needs an old version of typescript, so we cannot put the whole thing at the root, where it used to be.

To exclude files from processing, use [the `--exclude` flag](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/170#issuecomment-228983184).
