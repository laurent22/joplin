# 2021-11-04: Set to 13.0 because it crashes with 12.x
# https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/5671
#
# 2021-12-17: Changed back to 11.0 because after the fix it works with at least
# 12.x, and probably 11.0 too, which is the version supported by React Native.
#
# 2023-11-16: Changed to 13.0 to get Expo to work.
