# Note: it was 13.4 to get @react-native-community/datetimepicker to work but
# it's probably not necessary actually. Just needed to upgrade XCode.

# 2021-11-04: Set to 13.0 because it crashes with 12.x
# https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/5671
#
# 2021-12-17: Changed back to 11.0 because after the fix it works with at least
# 12.x, and probably 11.0 too, which is the version supported by React Native.
