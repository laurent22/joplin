# Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in Joplin Server, owned by JOPLIN (the
"Company"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, the Company must have a Contributor
License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor,
indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your
protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Company and its
users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose.

Please complete and sign this Agreement, and then email a copy to
cla@joplinapp.org only (do not copy any other persons or lists). Read this
document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and
future Contributions submitted to the Company. In return, the Company shall not
use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or
inconsistent with its bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except
for the license granted herein to the Company and recipients of software
distributed by the Company, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to
Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

   * "You" (or "Your")

     "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized
     by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Company. For
     legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities
     that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
     entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this
     definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,
     or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
     or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   * "Contribution"

     "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
     modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
     submitted by You to the Company for inclusion in, or documentation of, any
     of the products owned or managed by the Company (the "Work"). For the
     purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
     verbal, or written communication sent to the Company or its
     representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
     mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
     are managed by, or on behalf of, the Company for the purpose of discussing
     and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
     marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of software
   distributed by the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
   works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of software
   distributed by the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
   to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation
   against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have
   contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that
   Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If
   your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that
   includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission
   to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has
   waived such rights for your Contributions to the Company, or that your
   employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see
   section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your
   Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license
   or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and
   trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with
   any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
   extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
   fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
   without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
   submit it to the Company separately from any Contribution, identifying the
   complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
   (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
   agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
   work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: **NAME HERE**".

8. You agree to notify the Company of any facts or circumstances of which you
   become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
