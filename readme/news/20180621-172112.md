# Web Clipper now available on Firefox and Chrome

[One of the most requested feature](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/135), the Web Clipper, is now available on the Firefox and Chrome store. It is possible to save a whole web page, or a simplified version of it, or a screenshot directly from the browser to Joplin. Like the rest of Joplin, the HTML page will be converted to Markdown, which means it can be easily edited and read even without a special viewer, and, since it's plain text, it also makes it easier to search and share the content.

Have a look at the [Web Clipper documentation](https://joplin.cozic.net/clipper/) for more information.
