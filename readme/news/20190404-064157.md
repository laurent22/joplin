# Markdown plugins and Goto Anything

The latest release includes two relatively important new features:

The first one, is the addition of several Markdown plugins that enable new features: for example it's now possible to add a table of contents to your notes, to enable footnotes, or to render various text decorations, such as superscript, subscript, highlighting, etc. This was all made possible thanks to the efforts of Caleb John.

The second major new feature is the addition of the Goto Anything dialog. Press Ctrl+P or Cmd+P and type the title of a note to jump directly to it. You can also type # followed by a tag or @ followed by a notebook title. The feature was largely inspired by the cool Sublime Text Goto Anything feature.
