# Joplin will have a stand at the "Journées du Logiciel Libre" conference in Lyon, France

Just a quick announcement to let you know that on 3 and 4 April, we will have a stand for Joplin at the [Journées du Logiciel Libre](https://www.jdll.org/) in Lyon, France. The JdLL has been taking place in Lyon for 22 years and is a popular open source conference in France. Last year we had a stand too, but of course that was cancelled due to Covid. So this year is a first for Joplin so if you're around, come and say hi!

Also I am looking for anyone who could help look after the stand, even for an hour or two, over these two days. There won't be a lot to do - pretty much just hand over fliers and answer the occasional question, which as Joplin users I'm sure you'll know the answer to. Coffee and/or beers are on me :-) So if you aren't far and would be interested, please let me know!
