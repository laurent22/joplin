# Plugin Manifest

The manifest file is a JSON file that describes various properties of the plugin. If you use the Yeoman generator, it should be automatically generated based on the answers you've provided. The supported properties are:

Name | Type | Required? | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`manifest_version` | number | **Yes** | For now should always be "1".
`name` | string | **Yes** | Name of the plugin. Should be a user-friendly string, as it will be displayed in the UI.
`version` | string | **Yes** | Version number such as "1.0.0".
`app_min_version` | string | **Yes** | Minimum version of Joplin that the plugin is compatible with. In general it should be whatever version you are using to develop the plugin.
`description` | string | No | Detailed description of the plugin.
`author` | string | No | Plugin author name.
`keywords` | string[] | No | Keywords associated with the plugins. They are used in search in particular.
`homepage_url` | string | No | Homepage URL of the plugin. It can also be, for example, a link to a GitHub repository.
`repository_url` | string | No | Repository URL where the plugin source code is hosted.
