# Importing and exporting notes

## Importing from Evernote

Joplin can import complete Evernote notebooks, as well as notes, tags, images, attached files and note metadata (such as author, geo-location, etc.) via ENEX files.

To import Evernote data, first export your Evernote notebooks to ENEX files as described [here](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-How-to-back-up-export-and-restore-import-notes-and-notebooks). Then, on **desktop**, do the following: Open File > Import > ENEX and select your file. The notes will be imported into a new separate notebook. If needed they can then be moved to a different notebook, or the notebook can be renamed, etc. Read [more about Evernote import](https://joplinapp.org/help/#importing-from-evernote).

# Importing from other apps

Joplin can also import notes from [many other apps](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-other-applications) as well as [from Markdown or text files](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#importing-from-markdown-files).

# Exporting notes

Joplin can export to the JEX format (Joplin Export file), which is an archive that can contain multiple notes, notebooks, etc. This is a format mostly designed for backup purposes. You may also export to other formats such as plain Markdown files, to JSON or to PDF. Find out [more about exporting notes](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#exporting) on the official website.
