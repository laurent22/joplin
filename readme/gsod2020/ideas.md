# 1.Idea - Create documenation hub
- Make a screening of available options of how apps to be utilized to organize documentation better and simplified access to information.
You can start with:
    -  [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) 
    -  [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) or ...
- Make a screening of available tools to visualize dependencies of all Joplin components 
- create a consistent structure to allow to have them filled easily.
- create a high-level visualization of all Joplin structure 
- creating a basic documentation is minimum expectations 

# 2. Idea - introduce and describe a consistent workflow from bug report / feature request to pull request 
- create [Wizards]() for the Discourse forum 
- create templates at GitHub
- optimize the bot on GitHub
- show and may implement how the current Bug Report and Feature Request workflow can be improved using
  - [HubBoard](https://huboard.com/pricing) 
  - [GiHub Project Board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)

# 3. Idea - create a tool to collect ideas and suggestions based on the content of the community forum
There are many ideas in the forum and attempts to organize and streamline them.
Task is to find a toolset to structure them and make the knowledge buried in there available easily.

# 4. Idea - Divide panel into separate windows
Joplin has 4 panes: side bar, notes list, code and view. Change joplin in a way that these parts can be different windows. Thus it is possible to put these windows on different screens for more space and better overview.
