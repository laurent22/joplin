# Joplin Cloud synchronisation

[Joplin Cloud](https://joplinapp.org/plans/) is a web service specifically designed for Joplin. Besides synchronising your data, it also allows you to publish a note to the internet, or share a notebook with your friends, family or colleagues. Joplin Cloud, compared to other services, also features a number of performance improvements allowing for faster synchronisation.

To use it, go to the [Configuration screen](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/apps/config_screen.md), then to the Synchronisation section. In the list of sync targets, select "Joplin Cloud". Enter your email and password, and you're ready to use Joplin Cloud.
