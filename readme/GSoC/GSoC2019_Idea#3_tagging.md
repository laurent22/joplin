“[Feature Request] Tags on whole markdown lines #1498”: I prefer we remove this as this too far from standard markdown.

“Feature request: set @tags from markdown editor #1407”. I prefer if we remove this too for the same reason. I think tagging is already easy since there’s a keyboard shortcut for it. Maybe back then there wasn’t.

“So many tags #1221”: Was a bug, which has been fixed.
