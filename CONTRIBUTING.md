# Reporting a bug

Please check first that it [has not already been reported](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). Also consider [enabling debug mode](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/README_debugging.md) before reporting the issue so that you can provide as much details as possible to help fix it.

If possible, **please provide a screenshot**. A screenshot shownig the problem is often way more useful than a paragraph describing it as it can make it immediately clear what the issue is.

# Feature requests

Again, please check that it has not already been requested. If it has, simply **up-vote the issue** - the ones with the most up-votes are likely to be implemented. Adding a "+1" comment does nothing.

# Adding new features

If you want to add a new feature, consider asking about it before implementing it to make sure it is within the scope of the project. Of course you are free to create the pull request directly but it is not guaranteed it is going to be accepted.

Building the apps is relatively easy - please [see the build instructions](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/master/BUILD.md) for more details.

# Coding style

- Only use tabs for indentation, not spaces.
- Do not remove or add optional characters from other lines (such as colons or new line characters) as it can make the commit needlessly big, and create conflicts with other changes.
