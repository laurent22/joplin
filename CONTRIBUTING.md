# Adding new features
If you want to add a new feature, consider asking about it before implementing it to make sure it is within the scope of the project. Of course you are free to create the pull request directly but it is not guaranteed it is going to be accepted.

# Style
- Only use tabs for indentation, not spaces.
- Do not remove or add optional characters from other lines (such as colons or new line characters) as it can make the commit needlessly big, and create conflicts with other changes.
