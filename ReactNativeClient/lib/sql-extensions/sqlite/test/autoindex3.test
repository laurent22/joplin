# The t1b and t2d indexes are not very selective.  It used to be that
# the autoindex mechanism would create automatic indexes on t1(b) or
# t2(d), make assumptions that they were reasonably selective, and use
# them instead of t1b or t2d.  But that would be cheating, because the
# automatic index cannot be any more selective than the real index.
#
# This test verifies that the cheat is no longer allowed.
