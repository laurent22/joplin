** This file contains code for the VdbeSorter object, used in concert with
** a VdbeCursor to sort large numbers of keys for CREATE INDEX statements
** or by SELECT statements with ORDER BY clauses that cannot be satisfied
** using indexes and without LIMIT clauses.
**
** The VdbeSorter object implements a multi-threaded external merge sort
** algorithm that is efficient even if the number of elements being sorted
** exceeds the available memory.
**
** Here is the (internal, non-API) interface between this module and the
** rest of the SQLite system:
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterInit()       Create a new VdbeSorter object.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterWrite()      Add a single new row to the VdbeSorter
**                                  object.  The row is a binary blob in the
**                                  OP_MakeRecord format that contains both
**                                  the ORDER BY key columns and result columns
**                                  in the case of a SELECT w/ ORDER BY, or
**                                  the complete record for an index entry
**                                  in the case of a CREATE INDEX.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterRewind()     Sort all content previously added.
**                                  Position the read cursor on the
**                                  first sorted element.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterNext()       Advance the read cursor to the next sorted
**                                  element.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterRowkey()     Return the complete binary blob for the
**                                  row currently under the read cursor.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterCompare()    Compare the binary blob for the row
**                                  currently under the read cursor against
**                                  another binary blob X and report if
**                                  X is strictly less than the read cursor.
**                                  Used to enforce uniqueness in a
**                                  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterClose()      Close the VdbeSorter object and reclaim
**                                  all resources.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterReset()      Refurbish the VdbeSorter for reuse.  This
**                                  is like Close() followed by Init() only
**                                  much faster.
**
** The interfaces above must be called in a particular order.  Write() can 
** only occur in between Init()/Reset() and Rewind().  Next(), Rowkey(), and
** Compare() can only occur in between Rewind() and Close()/Reset(). i.e.
**
**   Init()
**   for each record: Write()
**   Rewind()
**     Rowkey()/Compare()
**   Next() 
**   Close()
**
** Algorithm:
**
** Records passed to the sorter via calls to Write() are initially held 
** unsorted in main memory. Assuming the amount of memory used never exceeds
** a threshold, when Rewind() is called the set of records is sorted using
** an in-memory merge sort. In this case, no temporary files are required
** and subsequent calls to Rowkey(), Next() and Compare() read records 
** directly from main memory.
**
** If the amount of space used to store records in main memory exceeds the
** threshold, then the set of records currently in memory are sorted and
** written to a temporary file in "Packed Memory Array" (PMA) format.
** A PMA created at this point is known as a "level-0 PMA". Higher levels
** of PMAs may be created by merging existing PMAs together - for example
** merging two or more level-0 PMAs together creates a level-1 PMA.
**
** The threshold for the amount of main memory to use before flushing 
** records to a PMA is roughly the same as the limit configured for the
** page-cache of the main database. Specifically, the threshold is set to 
** the value returned by "PRAGMA main.page_size" multipled by 
** that returned by "PRAGMA main.cache_size", in bytes.
**
** If the sorter is running in single-threaded mode, then all PMAs generated
** are appended to a single temporary file. Or, if the sorter is running in
** multi-threaded mode then up to (N+1) temporary files may be opened, where
** N is the configured number of worker threads. In this case, instead of
** sorting the records and writing the PMA to a temporary file itself, the
** calling thread usually launches a worker thread to do so. Except, if
** there are already N worker threads running, the main thread does the work
** itself.
**
** The sorter is running in multi-threaded mode if (a) the library was built
** with pre-processor symbol SQLITE_MAX_WORKER_THREADS set to a value greater
** than zero, and (b) worker threads have been enabled at runtime by calling
** "PRAGMA threads=N" with some value of N greater than 0.
**
** When Rewind() is called, any data remaining in memory is flushed to a 
** final PMA. So at this point the data is stored in some number of sorted
** PMAs within temporary files on disk.
**
** If there are fewer than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs in total and the
** sorter is running in single-threaded mode, then these PMAs are merged
** incrementally as keys are retreived from the sorter by the VDBE.  The
** MergeEngine object, described in further detail below, performs this
** merge.
**
** Or, if running in multi-threaded mode, then a background thread is
** launched to merge the existing PMAs. Once the background thread has
** merged T bytes of data into a single sorted PMA, the main thread 
** begins reading keys from that PMA while the background thread proceeds
** with merging the next T bytes of data. And so on.
**
** Parameter T is set to half the value of the memory threshold used 
** by Write() above to determine when to create a new PMA.
**
** If there are more than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs in total when 
** Rewind() is called, then a hierarchy of incremental-merges is used. 
** First, T bytes of data from the first SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs on 
** disk are merged together. Then T bytes of data from the second set, and
** so on, such that no operation ever merges more than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT
** PMAs at a time. This done is to improve locality.
**
** If running in multi-threaded mode and there are more than
** SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs on disk when Rewind() is called, then more
** than one background thread may be created. Specifically, there may be
** one background thread for each temporary file on disk, and one background
** thread to merge the output of each of the others to a single PMA for
** the main thread to read from.

/*
** The MergeEngine object is used to combine two or more smaller PMAs into

**
** The aReadr[] array contains a PmaReader object for each of the PMAs being
** merged.  An aReadr[] object either points to a valid key or else is at EOF.
** ("EOF" means "End Of File".  When aReadr[] is at EOF there is no more data.)
** For the purposes of the paragraphs below, we assume that the array is
** actually N elements in size, where N is the smallest power of 2 greater
** to or equal to the number of PMAs being merged. The extra aReadr[] elements
** are treated as if they are empty (always at EOF).
**
** The aTree[] array is also N elements in size. The value of N is stored in
** the MergeEngine.nTree variable.
**
** The final (N/2) elements of aTree[] contain the results of comparing
** pairs of PMA keys together. Element i contains the result of 
** comparing aReadr[2*i-N] and aReadr[2*i-N+1]. Whichever key is smaller, the
** aTree element is set to the index of it. 
**
** For the purposes of this comparison, EOF is considered greater than any
** other key value. If the keys are equal (only possible with two EOF
** values), it doesn't matter which index is stored.
**
** The (N/4) elements of aTree[] that precede the final (N/2) described 
** above contains the index of the smallest of each block of 4 PmaReaders
** And so on. So that aTree[1] contains the index of the PmaReader that 
** currently points to the smallest key value. aTree[0] is unused.
**
** Example:
**
**     aReadr[0] -> Banana
**     aReadr[1] -> Feijoa
**     aReadr[2] -> Elderberry
**     aReadr[3] -> Currant
**     aReadr[4] -> Grapefruit
**     aReadr[5] -> Apple
**     aReadr[6] -> Durian
**     aReadr[7] -> EOF
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 5   0, 5    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** The current element is "Apple" (the value of the key indicated by 
** PmaReader 5). When the Next() operation is invoked, PmaReader 5 will
** be advanced to the next key in its segment. Say the next key is
** "Eggplant":
**
**     aReadr[5] -> Eggplant
**
** The contents of aTree[] are updated first by comparing the new PmaReader
** 5 key to the current key of PmaReader 4 (still "Grapefruit"). The PmaReader
** 5 value is still smaller, so aTree[6] is set to 5. And so on up the tree.
** The value of PmaReader 6 - "Durian" - is now smaller than that of PmaReader
** 5, so aTree[3] is set to 6. Key 0 is smaller than key 6 (Banana<Durian),
** so the value written into element 1 of the array is 0. As follows:
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 0   0, 6    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** In other words, each time we advance to the next sorter element, log2(N)
** key comparison operations are required, where N is the number of segments
** being merged (rounded up to the next power of 2).

** This object represents a single thread of control in a sort operation.

**
**   2. If SQLITE_DEBUG_SORTER_THREADS is defined, to determine if a call

** Normally, a PmaReader object iterates through an existing PMA stored 
** within a temp file. However, if the PmaReader.pIncr variable points to
** an object of the following type, it may be used to iterate/merge through
** multiple PMAs simultaneously.
**
** There are two types of IncrMerger object - single (bUseThread==0) and 
** multi-threaded (bUseThread==1). 
**
** A multi-threaded IncrMerger object uses two temporary files - aFile[0] 
** and aFile[1]. Neither file is allowed to grow to more than mxSz bytes in 
** size. When the IncrMerger is initialized, it reads enough data from 
** pMerger to populate aFile[0]. It then sets variables within the 
** corresponding PmaReader object to read from that file and kicks off 
** a background thread to populate aFile[1] with the next mxSz bytes of 
** sorted record data from pMerger. 
**
** When the PmaReader reaches the end of aFile[0], it blocks until the
** background thread has finished populating aFile[1]. It then exchanges
** the contents of the aFile[0] and aFile[1] variables within this structure,
** sets the PmaReader fields to read from the new aFile[0] and kicks off
** another background thread to populate the new aFile[1]. And so on, until
** the contents of pMerger are exhausted.
**
** A single-threaded IncrMerger does not open any temporary files of its
** own. Instead, it has exclusive access to mxSz bytes of space beginning
** at offset iStartOff of file pTask->file2. And instead of using a 
** background thread to prepare data for the PmaReader, with a single
** threaded IncrMerger the allocate part of pTask->file2 is "refilled" with
** keys from pMerger by the calling thread whenever the PmaReader runs out
