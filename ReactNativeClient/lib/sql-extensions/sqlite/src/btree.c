** Set bit pgno of the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. This is called

** bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding
** free-list leaf pages:
**
**   1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes
**      a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database
**      (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data). Sometimes
**      such a page is not even journalled (as it will not be modified,
**      why bother journalling it?).
**
**   2) When a free-list leaf page is reused, its content is not read
**      from the database or written to the journal file (why should it
**      be, if it is not at all meaningful?).
**
** By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy
** performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations. However, if
** a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same
** transaction, a problem comes up. If the page is not journalled when
** it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it
** is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data
** may be lost. In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible
** to restore the database to its original configuration.
**
** The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. Whenever a page is 
** moved to become a free-list leaf page, the corresponding bit is
** set in the bitvec. Whenever a leaf page is extracted from the free-list,
** optimization 2 above is omitted if the corresponding bit is already

** This function is used to read or overwrite payload information

**
**   0: The operation is a read. Populate the overflow cache.
**   1: The operation is a write. Populate the overflow cache.
**
** A total of "amt" bytes are read or written beginning at "offset".
** Data is read to or from the buffer pBuf.
**
** The content being read or written might appear on the main page
** or be scattered out on multiple overflow pages.
**
** If the current cursor entry uses one or more overflow pages
** this function may allocate space for and lazily populate
** the overflow page-list cache array (BtCursor.aOverflow). 
** Subsequent calls use this cache to make seeking to the supplied offset 
** more efficient.
**
** Once an overflow page-list cache has been allocated, it must be
** invalidated if some other cursor writes to the same table, or if
** the cursor is moved to a different row. Additionally, in auto-vacuum
** mode, the following events may invalidate an overflow page-list cache.
**
**   * An incremental vacuum,

**
** The cells in this array are the divider cell or cells from the pParent
** page plus up to three child pages.  There are a total of nCell cells.
**
** pRef is a pointer to one of the pages that contributes cells.  This is
** used to access information such as MemPage.intKey and MemPage.pBt->pageSize
** which should be common to all pages that contribute cells to this array.
**
** apCell[] and szCell[] hold, respectively, pointers to the start of each
** cell and the size of each cell.  Some of the apCell[] pointers might refer
** to overflow cells.  In other words, some apCel[] pointers might not point
** to content area of the pages.
**
** A szCell[] of zero means the size of that cell has not yet been computed.
**
** The cells come from as many as four different pages:
**
**             -----------
**             | Parent  |
**             -----------
**            /     |     \
**           /      |      \
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**  |Child-1|   |Child-2|   |Child-3|
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**
** The order of cells is in the array is for an index btree is:
**
**       1.  All cells from Child-1 in order
**       2.  The first divider cell from Parent
**       3.  All cells from Child-2 in order
**       4.  The second divider cell from Parent
**       5.  All cells from Child-3 in order
**
** For a table-btree (with rowids) the items 2 and 4 are empty because
** content exists only in leaves and there are no divider cells.
**
** For an index btree, the apEnd[] array holds pointer to the end of page
** for Child-1, the Parent, Child-2, the Parent (again), and Child-3,
** respectively. The ixNx[] array holds the number of cells contained in
** each of these 5 stages, and all stages to the left.  Hence:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 plus 1 for first divider.
**    ixNx[2] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + 1 for 1st divider.
**    ixNx[3] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + both divider cells
**    ixNx[4] = Total number of cells.
**
** For a table-btree, the concept is similar, except only apEnd[0]..apEnd[2]
** are used and they point to the leaf pages only, and the ixNx value are:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2.
**    ixNx[2] = Total number of cells.

** This routine redistributes cells on the iParentIdx'th child of pParent
** (hereafter "the page") and up to 2 siblings so that all pages have about the
** same amount of free space. Usually a single sibling on either side of the
** page are used in the balancing, though both siblings might come from one
** side if the page is the first or last child of its parent. If the page 
** has fewer than 2 siblings (something which can only happen if the page
** is a root page or a child of a root page) then all available siblings
** participate in the balancing.
**
** The number of siblings of the page might be increased or decreased by 
** one or two in an effort to keep pages nearly full but not over full. 
**
** Note that when this routine is called, some of the cells on the page
** might not actually be stored in MemPage.aData[]. This can happen
** if the page is overfull. This routine ensures that all cells allocated
** to the page and its siblings fit into MemPage.aData[] before returning.
**
** In the course of balancing the page and its siblings, cells may be
** inserted into or removed from the parent page (pParent). Doing so
** may cause the parent page to become overfull or underfull. If this
** happens, it is the responsibility of the caller to invoke the correct
** balancing routine to fix this problem (see the balance() routine). 
**
** If this routine fails for any reason, it might leave the database
** in a corrupted state. So if this routine fails, the database should
** be rolled back.
**
** The third argument to this function, aOvflSpace, is a pointer to a
** buffer big enough to hold one page. If while inserting cells into the parent
** page (pParent) the parent page becomes overfull, this buffer is
** used to store the parent's overflow cells. Because this function inserts
** a maximum of four divider cells into the parent page, and the maximum
** size of a cell stored within an internal node is always less than 1/4
** of the page-size, the aOvflSpace[] buffer is guaranteed to be large
** enough for all overflow cells.
**
** If aOvflSpace is set to a null pointer, this function returns 
** SQLITE_NOMEM.
