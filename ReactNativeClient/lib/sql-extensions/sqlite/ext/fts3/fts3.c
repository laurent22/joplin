/* The full-text index is stored in a series of b+tree (-like)
** structures called segments which map terms to doclists.  The
** structures are like b+trees in layout, but are constructed from the
** bottom up in optimal fashion and are not updatable.  Since trees
** are built from the bottom up, things will be described from the
** bottom up.
**
**
**** Varints ****
** The basic unit of encoding is a variable-length integer called a
** varint.  We encode variable-length integers in little-endian order
** using seven bits * per byte as follows:
**
** KEY:
**         A = 0xxxxxxx    7 bits of data and one flag bit
**         B = 1xxxxxxx    7 bits of data and one flag bit
**
**  7 bits - A
** 14 bits - BA
** 21 bits - BBA
** and so on.
**
** This is similar in concept to how sqlite encodes "varints" but
** the encoding is not the same.  SQLite varints are big-endian
** are are limited to 9 bytes in length whereas FTS3 varints are
** little-endian and can be up to 10 bytes in length (in theory).
**
** Example encodings:
**
**     1:    0x01
**   127:    0x7f
**   128:    0x81 0x00
**
**
**** Document lists ****
** A doclist (document list) holds a docid-sorted list of hits for a
** given term.  Doclists hold docids and associated token positions.
** A docid is the unique integer identifier for a single document.
** A position is the index of a word within the document.  The first 
** word of the document has a position of 0.
**
** FTS3 used to optionally store character offsets using a compile-time
** option.  But that functionality is no longer supported.
**
** A doclist is stored like this:
**
** array {
**   varint docid;          (delta from previous doclist)
**   array {                (position list for column 0)
**     varint position;     (2 more than the delta from previous position)
**   }
**   array {
**     varint POS_COLUMN;   (marks start of position list for new column)
**     varint column;       (index of new column)
**     array {
**       varint position;   (2 more than the delta from previous position)
**     }
**   }
**   varint POS_END;        (marks end of positions for this document.
** }
**
** Here, array { X } means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in
** memory.  A "position" is an index of a token in the token stream
** generated by the tokenizer. Note that POS_END and POS_COLUMN occur 
** in the same logical place as the position element, and act as sentinals
** ending a position list array.  POS_END is 0.  POS_COLUMN is 1.
** The positions numbers are not stored literally but rather as two more
** than the difference from the prior position, or the just the position plus
** 2 for the first position.  Example:
**
**   label:       A B C D E  F  G H   I  J K
**   value:     123 5 9 1 1 14 35 0 234 72 0
**
** The 123 value is the first docid.  For column zero in this document
** there are two matches at positions 3 and 10 (5-2 and 9-2+3).  The 1
** at D signals the start of a new column; the 1 at E indicates that the
** new column is column number 1.  There are two positions at 12 and 45
** (14-2 and 35-2+12).  The 0 at H indicate the end-of-document.  The
** 234 at I is the delta to next docid (357).  It has one position 70
** (72-2) and then terminates with the 0 at K.
**
** A "position-list" is the list of positions for multiple columns for
** a single docid.  A "column-list" is the set of positions for a single
** column.  Hence, a position-list consists of one or more column-lists,
** a document record consists of a docid followed by a position-list and
** a doclist consists of one or more document records.
**
** A bare doclist omits the position information, becoming an 
** array of varint-encoded docids.
**
**** Segment leaf nodes ****
** Segment leaf nodes store terms and doclists, ordered by term.  Leaf
** nodes are written using LeafWriter, and read using LeafReader (to
** iterate through a single leaf node's data) and LeavesReader (to
** iterate through a segment's entire leaf layer).  Leaf nodes have
** the format:
**
** varint iHeight;             (height from leaf level, always 0)
** varint nTerm;               (length of first term)
** char pTerm[nTerm];          (content of first term)
** varint nDoclist;            (length of term's associated doclist)
** char pDoclist[nDoclist];    (content of doclist)
** array {
**                             (further terms are delta-encoded)
**   varint nPrefix;           (length of prefix shared with previous term)
**   varint nSuffix;           (length of unshared suffix)
**   char pTermSuffix[nSuffix];(unshared suffix of next term)
**   varint nDoclist;          (length of term's associated doclist)
**   char pDoclist[nDoclist];  (content of doclist)
** }
**
** Here, array { X } means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in
** memory.
**
** Leaf nodes are broken into blocks which are stored contiguously in
** the %_segments table in sorted order.  This means that when the end
** of a node is reached, the next term is in the node with the next
** greater node id.
**
** New data is spilled to a new leaf node when the current node
** exceeds LEAF_MAX bytes (default 2048).  New data which itself is
** larger than STANDALONE_MIN (default 1024) is placed in a standalone
** node (a leaf node with a single term and doclist).  The goal of
** these settings is to pack together groups of small doclists while
** making it efficient to directly access large doclists.  The
** assumption is that large doclists represent terms which are more
** likely to be query targets.
**
** TODO(shess) It may be useful for blocking decisions to be more
** dynamic.  For instance, it may make more sense to have a 2.5k leaf
** node rather than splitting into 2k and .5k nodes.  My intuition is
** that this might extend through 2x or 4x the pagesize.
**
**
**** Segment interior nodes ****
** Segment interior nodes store blockids for subtree nodes and terms
** to describe what data is stored by the each subtree.  Interior
** nodes are written using InteriorWriter, and read using
** InteriorReader.  InteriorWriters are created as needed when
** SegmentWriter creates new leaf nodes, or when an interior node
** itself grows too big and must be split.  The format of interior
** nodes:
**
** varint iHeight;           (height from leaf level, always >0)
** varint iBlockid;          (block id of node's leftmost subtree)
** optional {
**   varint nTerm;           (length of first term)
**   char pTerm[nTerm];      (content of first term)
**   array {
**                                (further terms are delta-encoded)
**     varint nPrefix;            (length of shared prefix with previous term)
**     varint nSuffix;            (length of unshared suffix)
**     char pTermSuffix[nSuffix]; (unshared suffix of next term)
**   }
** }
**
** Here, optional { X } means an optional element, while array { X }
** means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in memory.
**
** An interior node encodes n terms separating n+1 subtrees.  The
** subtree blocks are contiguous, so only the first subtree's blockid
** is encoded.  The subtree at iBlockid will contain all terms less
** than the first term encoded (or all terms if no term is encoded).
** Otherwise, for terms greater than or equal to pTerm[i] but less
** than pTerm[i+1], the subtree for that term will be rooted at
** iBlockid+i.  Interior nodes only store enough term data to
** distinguish adjacent children (if the rightmost term of the left
** child is "something", and the leftmost term of the right child is
** "wicked", only "w" is stored).
**
** New data is spilled to a new interior node at the same height when
** the current node exceeds INTERIOR_MAX bytes (default 2048).
** INTERIOR_MIN_TERMS (default 7) keeps large terms from monopolizing
** interior nodes and making the tree too skinny.  The interior nodes
** at a given height are naturally tracked by interior nodes at
** height+1, and so on.
**
**
**** Segment directory ****
** The segment directory in table %_segdir stores meta-information for
** merging and deleting segments, and also the root node of the
** segment's tree.
**
** The root node is the top node of the segment's tree after encoding
** the entire segment, restricted to ROOT_MAX bytes (default 1024).
** This could be either a leaf node or an interior node.  If the top
** node requires more than ROOT_MAX bytes, it is flushed to %_segments
** and a new root interior node is generated (which should always fit
** within ROOT_MAX because it only needs space for 2 varints, the
** height and the blockid of the previous root).
**
** The meta-information in the segment directory is:
**   level               - segment level (see below)
**   idx                 - index within level
**                       - (level,idx uniquely identify a segment)
**   start_block         - first leaf node
**   leaves_end_block    - last leaf node
**   end_block           - last block (including interior nodes)
**   root                - contents of root node
**
** If the root node is a leaf node, then start_block,
** leaves_end_block, and end_block are all 0.
**
**
**** Segment merging ****
** To amortize update costs, segments are grouped into levels and
** merged in batches.  Each increase in level represents exponentially
** more documents.
**
** New documents (actually, document updates) are tokenized and
** written individually (using LeafWriter) to a level 0 segment, with
** incrementing idx.  When idx reaches MERGE_COUNT (default 16), all
** level 0 segments are merged into a single level 1 segment.  Level 1
** is populated like level 0, and eventually MERGE_COUNT level 1
** segments are merged to a single level 2 segment (representing
** MERGE_COUNT^2 updates), and so on.
**
** A segment merge traverses all segments at a given level in
** parallel, performing a straightforward sorted merge.  Since segment
** leaf nodes are written in to the %_segments table in order, this
** merge traverses the underlying sqlite disk structures efficiently.
** After the merge, all segment blocks from the merged level are
** deleted.
**
** MERGE_COUNT controls how often we merge segments.  16 seems to be
** somewhat of a sweet spot for insertion performance.  32 and 64 show
** very similar performance numbers to 16 on insertion, though they're
** a tiny bit slower (perhaps due to more overhead in merge-time
** sorting).  8 is about 20% slower than 16, 4 about 50% slower than
** 16, 2 about 66% slower than 16.
**
** At query time, high MERGE_COUNT increases the number of segments
** which need to be scanned and merged.  For instance, with 100k docs
** inserted:
**
**    MERGE_COUNT   segments
**       16           25
**        8           12
**        4           10
**        2            6
**
** This appears to have only a moderate impact on queries for very
** frequent terms (which are somewhat dominated by segment merge
** costs), and infrequent and non-existent terms still seem to be fast
** even with many segments.
**
** TODO(shess) That said, it would be nice to have a better query-side
** argument for MERGE_COUNT of 16.  Also, it is possible/likely that
** optimizations to things like doclist merging will swing the sweet
** spot around.
**
**
**
**** Handling of deletions and updates ****
** Since we're using a segmented structure, with no docid-oriented
** index into the term index, we clearly cannot simply update the term
** index when a document is deleted or updated.  For deletions, we
** write an empty doclist (varint(docid) varint(POS_END)), for updates
** we simply write the new doclist.  Segment merges overwrite older
** data for a particular docid with newer data, so deletes or updates
** will eventually overtake the earlier data and knock it out.  The
** query logic likewise merges doclists so that newer data knocks out
** older data.

**
** If the expression is of type FTSQUERY_PHRASE, and the expression is not

**      entirely of deferred tokens, it is assumed to match every row in
**      the db. In this case the position-list is not populated at all. 
**
**      Or, if a phrase contains one or more deferred tokens and one or
**      more non-deferred tokens, then the expression is advanced to the 
**      next possible match, considering only non-deferred tokens. In other
**      words, if the phrase is "A B C", and "B" is deferred, the expression
**      is advanced to the next row that contains an instance of "A * C", 
**      where "*" may match any single token. The position list in this case
**      is populated as for "A * C" before returning.
**
**   2. NEAR is treated as AND. If the expression is "x NEAR y", it is 
**      advanced to point to the next row that matches "x AND y".
** 
** See sqlite3Fts3EvalTestDeferred() for details on testing if a row is
** really a match, taking into account deferred tokens and NEAR operators.
